Ingredients
- 6–8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, sliced to about 1/4inch thickness  
- 1 small bag of BBQ flavored Bissli (about 2.5 oz / 70 g)  - optional
- 2–3 cups panko breadcrumbs 
- 1 tbsp sesame 
- 1 tbsp BBQ/grill spice mix or paprika  
- 1 cup flour or cornstarch  
- 1/2 tsp of salt  
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp mustard  
- 1 cup canola or vegetable oil for frying  

Instructions
 1. Prepare the chicken  
Slice the chicken breasts into thin schnitzel pieces and place them on a wide tray.  
Sprinkle with a bit of salt and let sit for 10 minutes.  
Afterward, pat the pieces dry with paper towels.

 2. Set up your coating stations  
- Plate 1: flour  
- Plate 2: beaten eggs + salt + BBQ/paprika seasoning + mustard
- Bowl/tray: panko + sesame + finely crushed BBQ Bissli + 

Tip: Use one hand for the dry ingredients (flour and breadcrumb mix) and the other hand for the wet ingredients (egg). This keeps your hands cleaner.

 3. Coat the schnitzels  
Dip each chicken piece in this order:  
Flour → Egg → Breadcrumbs/Bissli mixture 
When coating with breadcrumbs, press down with your palm to flatten the schnitzel and help the coating stick.

 4. Finish coating  
Coat all the chicken pieces before you begin frying.

 5. Frying  
Heat half of the oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat.  
Fry the schnitzels until golden and crispy.
